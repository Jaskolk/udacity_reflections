This is my second reflections file:

Initializing a git repository is needed in order to tell git to start
tracking files in your directory.  otherwise, it doesn't know to do so.

The staging area is an interesting concept.  It is a virtual place that allows
the user some control over what files go into which commit and when.

Seems like a useful way to have a granular control of the commits.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
- you can do this by only adding relevant files to the staging area
- can also check by using git diff and git diff --staged to confirm
that the changes between working dir, staging area and and commits are as expected a
and one logical change at a time

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
I think git branches can be very useful.
They allow to try multiple ideas while preserving core code

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
Diagrams are very helpful to visualize
the branch structure which can otherwise be pretty confusing
They help figure out which commits are reachable from which other commits/branches

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
The result of merging 2 git branches is that you combine 2 paths of code together
it allows for more than one line of development or more than one developer to occur at the same time
the tree helps make it clear what's happening when you branch and merge
