This is my second reflections file:

Initializing a git repository is needed in order to tell git to start
tracking files in your directory.  otherwise, it doesn't know to do so.

The staging area is an interesting concept.  It is a virtual place that allows
the user some control over what files go into which commit and when.

Seems like a useful way to have a granular control of the commits.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
- you can do this by only adding relevant files to the staging area
- can also check by using git diff and git diff --staged to confirm
that the changes between working dir, staging area and and commits are as expected a
and one logical change at a time

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
I think git branches can be very useful.
They allow to try multiple ideas while preserving core code
