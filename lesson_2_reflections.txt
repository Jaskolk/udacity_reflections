This is my second reflections file:

Initializing a git repository is needed in order to tell git to start
tracking files in your directory.  otherwise, it doesn't know to do so.

The staging area is an interesting concept.  It is a virtual place that allows
the user some control over what files go into which commit and when.

Seems like a useful way to have a granular control of the commits.
