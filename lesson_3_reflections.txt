This is going to be a file for my lesson 3 reflections:

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
1. when collaborating with people online
2. when working from mulitple computers
3. perhaps as a safety mechanism - ie. a cloud backup

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- to make sure you know what changes your getting
- especially if collaborating with others
