This is going to be a file for my lesson 3 reflections:

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
1. when collaborating with people online
2. when working from mulitple computers
3. perhaps as a safety mechanism - ie. a cloud backup

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- to make sure you know what changes your getting
- especially if collaborating with others

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
clone is making a complete copy of reposity either on a local machine
or between a github repo and a logical
fork it coping a gitub repo to a new github repo in the cloud
- this is nice cause it still refers to the orginal repo but doesn't change it
against the owners will
- branches a versions of a repo and exist both on github and locally

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
- its a quick method of determining if the local is up to date
also gives a referecne to work from if there are multiple conflicts
